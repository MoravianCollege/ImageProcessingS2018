    """
    Shows a 2D Fourier transform using one of the following modes:
      * "mag" - the complex magnitude (default)
      * "color" - map complex numbers onto a color wheel using HSV color model
      
    For color mapping the complex angle is the hue (red is pos. real, cyan is
    neg. real, yellow/green is pos. imaginary, and purple is neg. imaginary),
    the saturation is 1, and the values are the complex magnitude; some hue
    adjustments are made to neighboring angles that are 180 from each other.
    
    By default the DC component of the image is eliminated and the magnitude
    data is log-scaled to make them displayable relative to each other. Set
    `log_scale` and `eliminate_dc` to False to turn these off.
    
    Instead of plotting the image the generated image can be returned so that
    it can be saved or otherwise manipulated.
